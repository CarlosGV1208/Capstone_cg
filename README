In this Capstone project, we address the following questions:

•	What factors explain why some countries have been more successful than others?
•	What policy levers and institutional conditions support or hinder the transition?
•	How sustainable are these shifts in terms of fiscal revenues, employment and export diversification? How have they supported or hindered credit quality?
