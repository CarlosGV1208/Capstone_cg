In this Capstone project, we address the following questions:

•	What factors explain why some countries have been more successful than others? <br>
•	What policy levers and institutional conditions support or hinder the transition? <br>
•	How sustainable are these shifts in terms of fiscal revenues, employment and export diversification? How have they supported or hindered credit quality? 

## Data sources:
   The data used for this project comes from 3 sources: <br><br>
        1) <a href="https://comtradeplus.un.org/" target="_blank">COMTRADE</a>: This source aggregates detailed global annual and monthly trade statistics 
        by product and trading partner. It covers approximately 200 countries and represents more than 99% of the world's merchandise trade. 
        It also has an API developer tool, which I integrated to my workflow. 
        <br><br>
        2) <a href="https://atlas.hks.harvard.edu/data-downloads" target="_blank">Harvard Atlas of Economic Complexity</a>: Using COMTRADE data,
        this website provides information about the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), Economic Complexity Rankings, and the Product Complexity Index (PCI).
        <br><br>
        3) <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">World Bank</a>: This source offers data on various health, inequality, and environmental outcomes.
